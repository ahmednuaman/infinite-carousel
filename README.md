Written with jQuery. To get started first you need to download jQuery and Handlebars into `components/jquery/` or save yourself some time and effort and use a dependancy manager, such as [Bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower): `bower install jquery handlebars`

Then run `index.html` in your favourite browser.
